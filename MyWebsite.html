   <p>Our passion for food started from childhood, which consisted of baking small cupcakes and through time led us to join and complete culinary school. The Sherifat & Idilâ€™s Cookbook helps a range of different cooks from the new and inexperienced with our 15-minute recipes to the more skilful cooks to show off their talent with our 45 minutes to 1-hour recipes. We have a variety of weekly recipes to choose from, due to our expertise and love for cooking that would interest those that have a healthy lifestyle to others who are just looking for a quick snack for the weekends! </p></br>
